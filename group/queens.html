                <h1>ETHNIC EATS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF QUEENS</h1>
                <p>Established in 1683 and named after the Queen of England, Scotland and Ireland, Catherine of Braganza, a Portugese princess, Queens became a borough of NYC in 1898.  It is the largest in area of the five boroughs and with a population of around 2 million people, Queens is the third most diverse county in the U.S.A. (right after Alaska's Aleutians West and Aleutians East counties with combined population of around 5,000 people).  The food of Queens is a direct mirror of this diversity.  Celebrated chef and television personality, Andrew Zimmern has called Queens "one of the world's best food towns" and the neighborhoods of Astoria, Flushing and Jackson Heights are some of the best food destinations in Queens.</p>

                <h2>ASTORIA</h2>
                <p>Originally called Hallett's Cove, Astoria was later named for John Jacob Astor, the richest man in America at the time.  Starting in the 1600s, the Dutch and Germans settled in Astoria.  One of the German settlers was Heinrich Steinweg, founder of the piano company Steinway & Sons.  During the 1800s and 1900s, the Irish arrived followed by Italians and Greeks.  Immigration from Greece and Cyprus rose in the mid 1900s and the effect is seen in the many bakeries and tavernas of Astoria.  In the 1970s, the Arab population grew which led to the opening of the Arab cafes and shops lining up Steinway Street.  Over the last few decades, immigrants from Bangladesh have also settled in Astoria.</p>

                    <p>Winner of the Vendy Award for Best Street Food in NYC in 2010, this street cart and later truck has been doling out some of the best falafels and shawarma in town all made from the owner's mother's recipe.  He opened his food cart in Astoria back in 2002 and his customers loved the falafel with homemade tahini sauce and shawarma made from marinated grilled meat and topped with pickled turnips, lettuce and onions on homemade pita.  Here the falafels are made Palestinian style and they come out crunchy but not greasy with soft and steamy interior.  Last year, the owner opened a restaurant by the same name also in Astoria.</p>

                <h2>FLUSHING</h2>
                <p>During the 1970s, immigrants from Taiwan began to arrive in NYC.  These Mandarin speaking immigrants faced communication and cultural problems in Manhattan's Cantonese speaking Chinatown and settled in Flushing instead.  This wave of immigrants from Taiwan was instrumental in establishing Flushing's Chinatown.  Over the years many new immigrants from different regions and provinces of China, speaking Mandarin and other non-Cantonese regional and provincial dialects, started to arrive in New York City and settled in Flushing as well.  The influence of this immigration is still very evident in the foods of Flushing and one of the best places to experience this is at its many food courts.</p>

The hand pulled noodles with cumin lamb in chili oil called Yang Rou Gan Che Mian is phenomenal.</p>
                        <li>Wang Zhen Qing Zhen Xiao Chi</li>
                        <p>This shop in stall C6 on the first floor serves snacks prepared in the Tianjin style, soups and some entrees.

                    </ul>

                <h2>JACKSON HEIGHTS</h2>
                <p>With the opening of the Queensboro Bridge in 1909, this area which was called Trains Meadow at the time became much more accessible and that same year the Queensboro Corporation was formed for planned housing development for Manhattan's middle income workers.  In 1916, the name was changed to Jackson Heights after Jackson Avenue, Northern Boulevard's former name, with the word "heights" chosen to indicate exclusivity.  The area started to become more diverse in the 1940s and starting in the 1970s Hispanic immigrants were arriving followed by South Asians mostly from India, Pakistan and Bangladesh over the last few decades and more recently from Nepal and Tibet.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li ><strong>Arepa Lady</strong></li>
                    <p>This food cart making Colombian food under the train track on Roosevelt Avenue  for close to 30 years is a street food legend.  Jim Leff who went on to found Chowhound raved about these arepas in the press back in the 1990s.  A restaurant of the same name opened in 2013.  The queso is cornmeal dough filled with cheese and topped with salted cheese which tastes salty and sweet at the same time and the choclo, made from fresh in house ground corn, is filled with heaps of your choice of meat (the carne asada tasted best) are both phenomenal.  Juice from blackberries, mango, passion fruit or other fruits mixed with milk or water are served in mason jars and are well worth trying.</p>

                    <li><strong>Kababish</strong></li>
                    <p>Skip the prepared selections and choose from the items on the made to order menu.  Serving the cuisine of Pakistan, this food shop makes great kababs, karai ghost which is wok prepared meat with lots of spices and cilantro and nahari or slow cooked beef or lamb stew with bone marrow.  The most sought after dish here is called Kat-A-Kat which is a spicy saute of minced goat brain, liver and kidney which takes around an hour to make after order and they always run out of the ingredients by dinner time so if this is what you want to try it is best to go in the afternoons.</p>
                    <li><strong>Thakali Kitchen</strong> and <strong>Phayul</strong></li>
                    <p>Both Thakali Kitchen and Phayul made the Best 5 List from CBS for best thalis and dumplings in NYC respectively.  Thakali Kitchen serves the cuisine of the Thakali people from the Mustang region of Nepal.  Thalis are platters arranged with curries, lentils, vegetables and pickles all in perfect portion. The thali with farsi goat option tastes delicious.  A NYT Critic's Pick, Phayul serves straight up Tibetan cuisine.  Nepali dumplings called momos filled with beef are really good.  The best item on the menu is the thenthuk, hand torn noodles with vegetables and chicken or beef in some really tasty broth.  This is the dish of the nomads from the steppes of the Amdo region of Tibet.</p>
