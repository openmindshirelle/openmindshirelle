        As an young adult myself, there are a lot of opportunities, and knowledge I wish I would have took advantage of in my teenage years. As a result, I learned that missing out on so many opportunities in my youthful years, has caused me to be confused with my direction of life as I am approaching my quarter century of life  </p> </center>

<p> The low-income neighborhoods in New York are the least-healthy county that had no nearby grocery store. There are a few other places where residents could easily buy fresh food. A lack of nearby healthy food can contribute to a poor diet. A grocery store in a poor neighborhood, doesnâ€™t make a very big difference.
